## Great themes

There's a stack of good looking themes included by default. Choose from
bootstrap, readthedocs, or any of the 12 bootswatch themes. You can also
check out a list of 3rd party themes in the MkDocs wiki, or better yet, add
your own.

## Preview your site as you work

The built-in devserver allows you to preview your documentation as you're
writing it. It will even auto-reload whenever you save any changes and refresh
your browser. So all your latest changes will be instantly available.
